<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I was born in Massachusetts and lived there until I was 5 years old, then we moved to the Central FL/Orlando area. I have been/lived in this area ever since.</p>
    <p>I have a wife of 10 years and a 7 year old son. My son inspires me to always do my best to set an example for him. And he is what motivates me to do my best to provide everything he needs and deserves.</p>
    <p>I am glad to have such great family and friends, that love and support me, even with such a drastic and huge change in my new career path.</p>
