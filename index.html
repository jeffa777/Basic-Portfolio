<h2>About Me</h2>

<hr>
    <p><img id="profilepic" src="assets\images\profilepic.png" alt="profile pic" width="250" height="350">I was born in Massachusetts and lived there until I was 5 years old, then we moved to the Central FL/Orlando area. I have been/lived in this area ever since.</p>
    <p>I have a wife of 10 years and a 7 year old son. My son inspires me to always do my best to set an example for him. And he is what motivates me to do anything I have to amd do everything to my best abilty, to provide everything he needs and deserves.</p>
    <p>I am glad to have such great family and friends, that love and support me, even with such a drastic and huge change in my new career path.</p>
    <p>It is proving to be a very challenging endeavor, but everyone in the class wants to help each other, which is awesome! Thankfully the study groups are extremely popular and very helpful.</p>
